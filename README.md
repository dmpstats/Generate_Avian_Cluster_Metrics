MoveApps

Github repository:
https://github.com/dmpstats/Generate_Avian_Cluster_Metrics

## Description

Generates cluster metrics from cluster-annotated locations data obtained
from an upstream clustering App. Returned cluster properties are
provided on the basis of summaries performed at track-per-cluster and/or
whole-cluster level.

## Documentation

This App is tasked with calculating cluster properties

At the practical level (real world relevance), generated cluster
attributes are pivotal for inferring points of interest for ground
patrolling purposes.

A description of the cluster attributes generated at each aggregation
level is provided below in Section [Cluster
Metrics](#list-of-cluster-metrics).

### MoveApps Worflow Dependencies

This App relies on the following prerequisites:

- Ensure the prior deployment of the App [Add Local and Solar
  Time](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/browser/43272925-cd24-466f-bcb9-844a09f1806b)
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/movestore/Convert-Times)) in the
  workflow.

- The input data must contain a column providing cluster annotations for
  location points. Use Apps like [Avian Cluster
  Detection](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/browser/81f41b8f-0403-4e9f-bc48-5a064e1060a2)
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/dmpstats/Avian_Cluster_Detection))
  earlier in the workflow to detect and identify spatial clusters from
  tracking data\].

- Optionally, the App can produce behavioural-related cluster metrics if
  the input data includes the required information. Use Apps such as
  [Behavioural Classification for
  Vultures](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/browser/44bb2ffa-7d40-4fad-bff5-1269995ba1a2)
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/dmpstats/Behavioural_Classification_for_Vultures))
  earlier in the workflow to derive and bind behavioural categories to
  the input data.

### Input data

A `move2::move2_loc` object.

### Output data

A `move2::move2_loc` object.

### Artefacts

None

### Settings

**Cluster ID Column** (`cluster_id_col`): character string, the name of
the column in the input data indicating the cluster IDs of location
points. Default: `clust_id`.

**Behaviour Category Column** (`behav_col`): character string, the name
of the column in the input data indicating the behavioural categories of
location points. Setting this to `NULL` will skip the derivation of
behavioural-related cluster metrics. Default: `behav`.

**Cluster Metrics Aggregation Level** (`cluster_tbl_type`): choose
whether to generate metrics at both the track-per-cluster level and
whole-cluster levels (`"track-and-whole"`) or solely at the
whole-cluster level (`"whole-only"`). Default: `"track-and-whole"`.

### Most common errors

*Please describe shortly what most common errors of the App can be, how
they occur and best ways of solving them.*

### Null or error handling

*Please indicate for each setting as well as the input data which
behaviour the App is supposed to show in case of errors or NULL
values/input. Please also add notes of possible errors that can happen
if settings/parameters are improperly set and any other important
information that you find the user should be aware of.*

*Example:* **Setting `radius`:** If no radius AND no duration are given,
the input data set is returned with a warning. If no radius is given
(NULL), but a duration is defined then a default radius of 1000m = 1km
is set.

<!-- generating data on the cluster's properties (hours spent, number of revisits, number of animals, and so on) -->
<!-- At the end of the process, a cluster-table (detailing various cluster attributes) is also generated and released as a *move2* object. -->

### Cluster Metrics

This section provides a full description of the cluster metrics
generated in the App [Generate Avian Cluster
Metrics](https://github.com/dmpstats/Generate_Avian_Cluster_Metrics),
including how each attribute is calculated and their significance.

#### Track-per-Cluster Level

The attributes listed below denote column names of a dataset where each
row represents a subset of track location points spatially grouped into
a cluster event. Track ID is extracted using the function
`move2::mt_track_id_column()`, while cluster ID is specified by the App
parameter `clust_id_col`. This dataset constitutes the events table of
the `move2_loc` output object when the App setting `cluster_tbl_type` is
defined to `"track-and-whole"`.

#### Whole-Cluster Level

The following attributes are column names of a dataset where each row
represents the properties of a cluster event, which can comprise one or
multiple tracks at any given time during the clusterâ€™s existence.
Cluster IDs are provided in the input data column specified by App
parameter `clust_id_col`. The placement of this dataset in the output
`move2_loc` object is determined by the App setting `cluster_tbl_type`:

- if `"track-and-whole"` (default), it is provided as the track table
- if `cluster_tbl_type = "whole-only"`, is is outputted as the events
  table

[^1]: If the `nightpoint` column is not present in the input data, it
    will derived internally based on `sunrise_timestamp` and
    `sunset_timestamp` columns. These columns are prerequisites that
    must be added using the â€˜Add Local and Solar Timeâ€™ App.
