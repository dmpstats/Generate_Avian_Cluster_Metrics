MoveApps

Github repository:
https://github.com/dmpstats/Generate_Avian_Cluster_Metrics

## Description

Generates cluster metrics from cluster-annotated locations data obtained
from an upstream clustering App. Returns cluster properties summarized
at track-per-cluster and/or whole-cluster levels.

## Documentation

This App calculates a range of metrics for clusters of animal locations
grouped based on spatio-temporal proximity. It is designed to be used
with tracking data that has been processed through a spatial clustering
App, requiring track locations to be labelled with cluster IDs.

Outputted metrics describe various cluster attributes including cluster
timespan, daily and compounded attendance levels, summaries of
behavioural activities within the cluster (if input data includes
annotations of animal behaviour), frequency and duration of cluster
visits, and information on first arrivals and night-time travelled
distances to the cluster. Calculations are performed at both
track-per-cluster and whole-cluster levels. A detailed description of
the cluster metrics generated at each aggregation level is provided
below in Section [Cluster Metrics](#cluster-metrics).

In practice, cluster attributes generated by this App can play a pivotal
role on inferring points of interest for ground patrolling purposes and
guiding response actions in animal protection efforts.

### MoveApps Worflow Dependencies

This App relies on the following prerequisites:

- Ensure the prior deployment of the App [Add Local and Solar
  Time](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/browser/43272925-cd24-466f-bcb9-844a09f1806b)
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/movestore/Convert-Times)) in the
  workflow, selecting the binding of local, sunset and sunrise times.

- The input data must contain a column providing cluster annotations for
  location points. Use Apps like [Avian Cluster
  Detection](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/browser/81f41b8f-0403-4e9f-bc48-5a064e1060a2)
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/dmpstats/Avian_Cluster_Detection))
  earlier in the workflow to detect and identify spatial clusters from
  tracking data\].

- Optionally, the App can produce behavioural-related cluster metrics if
  the input data includes the required information. Use Apps such as
  [Behavioural Classification for
  Vultures](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/browser/44bb2ffa-7d40-4fad-bff5-1269995ba1a2)
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/dmpstats/Behavioural_Classification_for_Vultures))
  earlier in the workflow to derive and bind behavioural categories to
  the input data.

### Input data

A `move2::move2_loc` object.

### Output data

A `move2::move2_loc` object. The format of the output dataset can be
either cluster-based tables or retain the same structure as the input
data (i.e. by track location event). See the [Settings](#settings)
section below for further details.

### Artefacts

None

### Settings

**Cluster ID Column** (`cluster_id_col`): character string, the name of
the column in the input data indicating the cluster IDs of location
points. Default: `"clust_id"`.

**Behaviour Category Column** (`behav_col`): character string, the name
of the column in the input data indicating the behavioural categories of
location points. Setting this to `NULL` will skip the derivation of
behavioural-related cluster metrics. Default: `"behav"`.

**Output Type** (`output_type`): Choose the data format for outputting
derived cluster metrics. Two options available:

1.  As a compact cluster-based dataset (`"cluster-based"`, default) -
    see setting **Cluster-based Output Content** for additional options.
2.  Merge [whole-cluster](#whole-cluster-level) metrics to track
    location points provided in the input data (`"merge-to-locs"`). Note
    that non-clustered location points are not carried forward. This
    option must be selected if using the ‘EarthRanger Integration’ App
    as a downstream App.

**Cluster-based Output Content** (`cluster_tbl_type`): If **Output
Type** is set to `"cluster-based"`, choose the content of the output
dataset:

1.  Metrics at both [track-per-cluster](#track-per-cluster-level) and
    [whole-cluster](#whole-cluster-level) levels (`"track-and-whole"`,
    default)
2.  Solely [whole-cluster](#whole-cluster-level) level metrics
    (`"whole-only"`)

### Most common errors

The app will halt processing an throw an error under the following
conditions:

- Failing to deploy the App ‘Add Local and Solar Time’ earlier in the
  workflow, as several of the calculated metrics rely on the presence of
  additional time-related columns in the input data.

- Specifying a **Cluster ID Column** or a **Behaviour Category Column**
  that is not included in the input data.

### Null or error handling

- **Behaviour Category Column**: if no column name is given (`NULL`),
  the app will not attempt to produce behavioural-based cluster metrics.

### Cluster Metrics

This section provides a detailed description of the cluster metrics
generated in this App, including how each attribute is calculated.

#### Track-per-Cluster Level

The attributes listed below denote column names of a dataset where each
row represents a subset of track location points spatially grouped into
a cluster event. Track ID is extracted using the function
`move2::mt_track_id_column()`, while cluster ID is specified by the App
parameter `cluster_id_col`. This dataset constitutes the events table of
the `move2_loc` output object when the App settings `output_type` is set
to `"cluster-based"` and `cluster_tbl_type` is defined to
`"track-and-whole"`.

Only calculated when accelerometer data is available. | Median and SD of ACC variances on track points annotated with each cluster ID |

#### Whole-Cluster Level

Attributes specified table below are column names of the whole-cluster
metrics dataset generated during the App’s calculations. Each row
represents the properties of a cluster event, which can comprise one or
multiple tracks at any given time during the cluster’s existence.
Cluster IDs are provided in the input data column specified by App
parameter `cluster_id_col`. The rendering of these metrics in the App’s
output is defined by settings `output_type` and `cluster_tbl_type`:

- if `output_type` is set to `"cluster-based"`, whole-cluster metrics
  are provided as a dedicated table, with its placement in the
  `move2_loc` output object determined by the `cluster_tbl_type`
  setting:

  - if `cluster_tbl_type = "track-and-whole"` (default), metrics are
    provided as the track table
  - if `cluster_tbl_type = "whole-only"`, metrics are outputted as the
    events table

- if `output_type` is set to `"merge-to-locs"`, then whole-metrics are
  included alongside track locations, with repeated metric values for
  location points associated with a common cluster ID.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When `output_type` is set to `"merge-to-locs"`, a prefix “`cl_`” is
> added to the names of all cluster-level properties to distinguish them
> from track location attributes.

[^1]: If the `nightpoint` column is not present in the input data, it
    will derived internally based on `sunrise_timestamp` and
    `sunset_timestamp` columns. These columns are prerequisites that
    must be added using the ‘Add Local and Solar Time’ App.

[^2]: In the absence of night-point locations for a given date for the
    track forming/visiting the cluster, take the track’s first point of
    the next day to calculate the intended night-time distance. Beware:
    NAs can still occur when there is no next day data available for the
    track.

[^3]: In the absence of night-point locations on the date of arrival of
    the track forming/visiting the cluster, take the track’s last point
    of the previous day to calculate the intended arrival distance.
    Beware: NAs can still occur when there is no track data on the
    previous day.
