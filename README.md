## Description

Generates cluster metrics from cluster-annotated locations data obtained
from an upstream clustering App. Returns cluster properties summarized
at track-per-cluster and/or whole-cluster levels.

## Documentation

This App calculates various metrics for clusters of animal locations
grouped based on spatio-temporal proximity. It is designed to be used
with tracking data that has been processed through a spatial clustering
App, requiring locations to be labelled with cluster IDs. Additionally,
it provides cluster-specific summaries of behavioural activities if the
input data includes annotations of animal behaviour.

App output can be rendered at both track-per-cluster and whole-cluster
levels. A detailed description of the cluster metrics generated at each
aggregation level is provided below in Section [Cluster
Metrics](#cluster-metrics).

In practice, cluster attributes generated by this App can play a pivotal
role on inferring points of interest for ground patrolling purposes and
guiding response actions in animal protection efforts.

### MoveApps Worflow Dependencies

This App relies on the following prerequisites:

- Ensure the prior deployment of the App [Add Local and Solar
  Time](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/browser/43272925-cd24-466f-bcb9-844a09f1806b)
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/movestore/Convert-Times)) in the
  workflow, selecting the binding of local, sunset and sunrise times.

- The input data must contain a column providing cluster annotations for
  location points. Use Apps like [Avian Cluster
  Detection](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/browser/81f41b8f-0403-4e9f-bc48-5a064e1060a2)
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/dmpstats/Avian_Cluster_Detection))
  earlier in the workflow to detect and identify spatial clusters from
  tracking data\].

- Optionally, the App can produce behavioural-related cluster metrics if
  the input data includes the required information. Use Apps such as
  [Behavioural Classification for
  Vultures](https://www.moveapps.org/apps/browser/44bb2ffa-7d40-4fad-bff5-1269995ba1a2)
  ([GitHub](https://github.com/dmpstats/Behavioural_Classification_for_Vultures))
  earlier in the workflow to derive and bind behavioural categories to
  the input data.

### Input data

A `move2::move2_loc` object.

### Output data

A `move2::move2_loc` object.

### Artefacts

None

### Settings

**Cluster ID Column** (`cluster_id_col`): character string, the name of
the column in the input data indicating the cluster IDs of location
points. Default: `"clust_id"`.

**Behaviour Category Column** (`behav_col`): character string, the name
of the column in the input data indicating the behavioural categories of
location points. Setting this to `NULL` will skip the derivation of
behavioural-related cluster metrics. Default: `"behav"`.

**Cluster Metrics Aggregation Level** (`cluster_tbl_type`): choose
whether to generate metrics at both the track-per-cluster level and
whole-cluster levels (`"track-and-whole"`) or solely at the
whole-cluster level (`"whole-only"`). Default: `"track-and-whole"`.

### Most common errors

The app will halt processing an throw an error under the following
conditions:

- Failing to deploy the App ‘Add Local and Solar Time’ earlier in the
  workflow, as several of the calculated metrics rely on the presence of
  additional time-related columns in the input data.

- Specifying a **Cluster ID Column** or a **Behaviour Category Column**
  that is not included in the input data.

### Null or error handling

- **Behaviour Category Column**: if no column name is given (`NULL`),
  the app will not attempt to produce behavioural-based cluster metrics.

### Cluster Metrics

This section provides a full description of the cluster metrics
generated in the App [Generate Avian Cluster
Metrics](https://github.com/dmpstats/Generate_Avian_Cluster_Metrics),
including how each attribute is calculated and their significance.

#### Track-per-Cluster Level

The attributes listed below denote column names of a dataset where each
row represents a subset of track location points spatially grouped into
a cluster event. Track ID is extracted using the function
`move2::mt_track_id_column()`, while cluster ID is specified by the App
parameter `clust_id_col`. This dataset constitutes the events table of
the `move2_loc` output object when the App setting `cluster_tbl_type` is
defined to `"track-and-whole"`.

#### Whole-Cluster Level

The following attributes are column names of a dataset where each row
represents the properties of a cluster event, which can comprise one or
multiple tracks at any given time during the cluster’s existence.
Cluster IDs are provided in the input data column specified by App
parameter `clust_id_col`. The placement of this dataset in the output
`move2_loc` object is determined by the App setting `cluster_tbl_type`:

- if `"track-and-whole"` (default), it is provided as the track table
- if `cluster_tbl_type = "whole-only"`, it is outputted as the events
  table

[^1]: If the `nightpoint` column is not present in the input data, it
    will derived internally based on `sunrise_timestamp` and
    `sunset_timestamp` columns. These columns are prerequisites that
    must be added using the ‘Add Local and Solar Time’ App.
